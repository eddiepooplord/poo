        <h2>Review Summary:</h2>
        <p><em>Nobody Knows</em> (誰も知らない, Dare mo Shiranai) is a strange and haunting film by acclaimed director Hirokazu Kore-eda. Based on a true story, the film dives into the lives of four children who are left to live by themselves in a small apartment after their mother abandons them. With a restrained yet powerful narrative, Kore-eda crafts a deeply moving and thought-provoking film.</p>

        <h2>My Detailed Review:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>The film centers on 12-year-old Akira, played by Yūya Yagira in a remarkable performance that earned him the Best Actor award at the Cannes Film Festival. Akira becomes the guardian for his younger siblings, striving to maintain a sense of normalcy in their unpredictable situation. The children's precarious situation is depicted with a quiet realismch.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Kore-eda's direction is marked by attention to detail and a profound empathy for his characters. The film's pacing is slow, allowing the audience to fully immerse themselves in the children's world. This immersion is further enhanced by the naturalistic performances of the child actors, whose authentic portrayals give the film a documentary-like quality.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The cinematography is subtle yet expressive, capturing the confines of the small apartment and the escaping and fleeting moments of joy and sorrow that fully reprsent the children's lives. The use of natural light and handheld cameras adds to the film's intimate and raw aesthetic, making the viewers feel as if they are silent observers of the tragedy.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>One of the film's striking aspects is its exploration of the themes of abandonment and resilience. The children's ability to adapt and find small bits of happiness amidst their circumstances is both heartbreaking and inspiring. Kore-eda tries to not pass judgment on to the mother, instead presenting a portrayal that invites the audience to reflect on the social issue.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>The emotional impact of <em>Nobody Knows</em> is profound, leaving a lasting impression. It represents Kore-eda's skill as a filmmaker that he can express such a deep emotional response through a story that is both simple and complex. The film's quiet power lies in its ability to humanize the forgotten and give voice to those who are often ignored by society.</p>

        <p>In conclusion, <em>Nobody Knows</em> is a masterful work of cinema that offers a look at the lives of its protagonists. Hirokazu Kore-eda has created a film that is both an artistic triumph and a touching social commentary. It is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates the power of cinema to clarify the human condition.</p>
